# Assignment-problem
Assignment problemAn O(n^4) implementation of the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm (a.k.a. the Hungarian algorithm) for solving the assignment problem. The assignment problem takes a set of agents, a set of tasks and a cost associated with assigning each agent to each task and produces an optimal (i.e., least cost) assignment of agents to tasks.
